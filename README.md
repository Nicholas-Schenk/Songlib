# Songlib

Delete is now fully working (deletes selected song from the list and then on close the program writes the updated list of songs to the file songs.txt)

It probably will need to change slightly because the display rn needs a bit of work to be useful for the other two functions (change Texts to Text fields so that user can input new data for songs)

Edit and Add are both slightly harder than Delete because they need to check a lot of stuff before actually making the update but they still shouldnt be too bad

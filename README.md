Added a bunch of stuff to cover the small details in the assignment instructions. All inputs are trimmed of leading and trailing spaces. Added a bunch of pop-up dialogue boxes to confirm all user actions (add/edit/delete). Added error dialogues for any errors. 

Tested it a bit but I problably didnt think of all test cases.
